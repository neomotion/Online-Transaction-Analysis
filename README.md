# Online-Transaction-Analysis
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning pipeline for detecting fraudulent transactions in a customer's online transaction history.
Using an XGBoost model for classification, we aim to accurately identify and flag potentially fraudulent activities.

# Features
1. Data Analysis and Preprocessing:
 Comprehensive analysis and preprocessing of the transaction dataset to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.

2.Fraud Detection Model: 
 Implementation of the XGBoost algorithm to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

3.Hyperparameter Tuning:
 Utilization of Hyperopt for optimizing the hyperparameters of the XGBoost model to enhance performance.

4.Evaluation Metrics:
 Assessment of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5.Visualization:
 Visual representation of data distribution, feature importance, and model performance metrics.

# Technology Stack
1. XGBoost:

   XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful and efficient implementation of the gradient boosting framework.
   It is designed to be highly efficient, flexible, and portable, making it a popular choice for machine learning tasks involving structured data. Key features include:

  Parallel Processing: XGBoost can take advantage of multi-core processors for faster training.
  
  Regularization: L1 and L2 regularization to avoid overfitting.
  
  Tree Pruning: A robust tree pruning mechanism to prevent over-complexity.
  
  Handling Missing Values: XGBoost automatically learns the best direction to handle missing values.

2. HyperOpt:
 Hyperopt is a powerful tool for performing hyperparameter optimization. It uses a combination of random search, Bayesian optimization, and other techniques to efficiently search the hyperparameter space for the best configuration.

   Key features include:

  Search Algorithms: Support for various search algorithms like random search, Tree of Parzen Estimators (TPE), and adaptive TPE.
  
  Scalability: Can scale to large search spaces and distributed computing environments.
  
  Flexibility: Works with any Python-based machine learning framework, including XGBoost.

3. Evaluation Metrics
 To evaluate the performance of our fraud detection model, we use several key metrics:

  Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified transactions (both fraudulent and legitimate) out of the total transactions.
  
  Precision: The ratio of correctly identified fraudulent transactions to the total transactions identified as fraudulent.
  
  Recall (Sensitivity): The ratio of correctly identified fraudulent transactions to the total actual fraudulent transactions.
  
  F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both.
  
  Confusion Matrix: A matrix showing the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives to give a detailed view of the model's performance.
